# Personalized_Cancer_Diagnosis
Classify a genetic mutation into 9 classes based on the evidence from the text based clinical literature. These 9 classes represent different levels of whether or not the genetic variant (gene) is a driver or passenger mutation.

Automated the process of analyzing and classifying the gene & variation data based on the relevant evidences in the text-based clinical literature. Detailed EDA is carried out on all the features. Based on the nature of the problem, multi-class log loss and confusion matrices (precision and recall) are used to evaluate the model performance. Analyzed the data using various models like Naive Bayes, K-NN, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, Stacking Classifier and Majority Voting classifier. Compared the perfomance of using all these models using log-loss and confusion matrices are performance metrics.
